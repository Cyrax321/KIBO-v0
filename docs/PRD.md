**Author:** Kibo Systems  

## 1. Executive Summary
Kibo is an intelligent career orchestration platform designed to transform the disjointed and stressful process of job hunting into a gamified, data-driven workflow. By combining Kanban-style application tracking, real-time coding practice analytics, and competitive leaderboards, Kibo empowers software engineers to maintain momentum and optimize their placement success rate.

## 2. Problem Statement
Software engineers facing the recruitment cycle encounter frequent burn-out due to:
*   **Lack of Visibility:** Difficulty tracking hundreds of applications across different statuses.
*   **Skill Decay:** Inconsistent coding practice during interview preparation.
*   **Motivation Loss:** The solitary nature of job hunting leads to rapid attrition of effort.
*   **Data Fragmentation:** No single source of truth for interview schedules, study progress, and application health.

## 3. Product Goals
*   **Gamify Productivity:** Increase user retention and daily activity through XP, streaks, and leaderboards.
*   **Centralize Operations:** Provide a "Mission Control" dashboard for all career-related activities.
*   **Real-Time Feedback:** Deliver instant gratification for user actions (application status changes, problems solved).
*   **Community Engagement:** Foster healthy competition via global leaderboards.

## 4. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Junior to Senior Software Engineers actively looking for new roles.
*   **Secondary:** Computer Science students preparing for internship seasons.

## 5. Key Features & Scope

### 5.5 Schedule & Notifications
*   **Event Calender:** Track interviews and contests.
*   **Smart Alerts:** Push notifications 15 minutes prior to scheduled events.

## 6. Success Metrics (KPIs)
*   **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Consistency of login streaks.
*   **Application Conversion Rate:** % of applications moving from "Applied" to "Interview".
*   **Problem Solve Rate:** Average number of coding problems solved per active user per week.

## 7. Roadmap regarding Future Iterations
